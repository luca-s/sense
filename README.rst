A basic Super Nintendo emulator for didactic purpose
====================================================

This project is not intended for running actual games (even though some of them work fine) but instead it is a basic emulator whose purpose is to show how an emulator works. 


The Super Nintendo Entertainment System is a videogame console with a custom 16bit processor based on 65c816, a dedicated graphic chip, a dedicated audio chip, several DMA channels and multiple input devices.
